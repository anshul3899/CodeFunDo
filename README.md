## Synopsis

There's nothing like a little old school Pacman game right? We are planning to rebuid our version of the great arcade game Pac Man which can be played on an any android device. Never played before?! What?! Eat all the pellets to complete a stage while trying to score as many points as possible by eating fruit and ghosts along the way!

This project is a very basic Android implementation of the pacman game. So, our pacman just goes up when you press on the screen and down when you release it. You get points when you eat yellow/blue squares and game gets over when you get hit by black ones. At the end of the game your score is displayed aong with the highest score. Therefore, newbies in Java and Android are welcomed if they want to contribute to the android game project from scratch. 

## Code Example

If you don't know anything about Android then it's time that you know about atleast the project structure of an android project. This will help you explore the peoject well. In a nutshell, try .java files do the logical stuff and .xml files handles the UI. We have to do a lot of worlk with UI. So, XML will help.

## Motivation
